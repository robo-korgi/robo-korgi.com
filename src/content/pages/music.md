## Sonic exploration ðŸŽ§

I try to listen to at least one thing I've never heard before every workday â€” an album, an artist, a genre, a mix, whatever. I've loved listening to music since I was little. I remember finding my mom's old vinyl records like Led Zepplin III and the self-titled Santana record and putting them on and being amazed.

This page is where Iâ€™ll eventually start posting about the new stuff Iâ€™m listening to, whatâ€™s stuck with me, and what I keep coming back to.
