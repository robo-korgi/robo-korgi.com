## CODER, STREAMER, AUTIST, DREAMER

I started making bad lofi music under the name robo-korgi a few years back. Now, the robo-korgi digital empire also includes Fortnite highlight vids and Twitch live-coding app development livestreams. I found out recently (in my 40s, because why not) that:


1. I'm autistic  
2. I have ADHD  
3. U.S. democracy is likely collapsing, and  
4. Humanity will probably lose the climate fight — and has already begun to lose.


(I'm not a doomer; I just don't think pretending helps.) So I'll blog about those uplifting topics a bit.
