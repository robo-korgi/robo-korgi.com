## My favorite podcast ðŸŽ§

*Behind the Bastards* is my favorite podcast. It's really interesting and most of the time, it's stuff I can't believe I didn't know already.

Itâ€™s a podcast about "the worst people in history". Politicians, warlords, tech bros, cult leaders, etc., and cartoonishly evil billionaires â€” all with wild stories, dark humor, and painfully good research.

### This page is my personal listening log

Iâ€™m going back to the beginning and slowly relistening to every episode. No rush. No pressure. Just a chance to jot down a few thoughts after each one. What stood out, what I learned, what made me yell at the void.

More soon. And if youâ€™re new to the show, start with the two-parter on Henry Kissinger and prepare yourself.
